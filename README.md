# Using-PINNs-to-predict-non-Newtonian-flows

An in-depth final year project which analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of utilizing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for predicting non-Newtonian fluid flow. Some of the non-Newtonian fluid flow models studied in the paper include the Carreau-Yasuda model and the Cross Power-Law model. The velocity and pressure profiles predicted by the constructed PINN are compared against the ground-truth data obtained through OpenFOAM simulation. 

The physics-informed neural network approach offers a versatile and efficient tool for predicting and analysing complex fluid systems, providing a bridge between traditional fluid mechanics and modern data-driven techniques. With further advancements and refinements, this approach holds great potential for enhancing design processes, optimization strategies, and decision-making in fluid dynamics applications.
